# Sorting Algorithms

TODO: Make sure that you delete all of the TODO markers and either
delete or rephrase all of the prompts inside of this file. When you are
finished writing this reflection it should contain technical details,
empirical results, and an analysis of the results that are suitable for
publication on your professional web site.

## Add Your Name Here

## Program Output

### Report at least five examples of program output to demonstrate that your `listsorting` program works correctly

#### First output from running the `listsorting` program with bubble_sort

TODO: Provide an output from running the final version of your program

#### Second output from running the `listsorting` program with insertion_sort

TODO: Provide an output from running the final version of your program

#### Third output from running the `listsorting` program with merge_sort

TODO: Provide an output from running the final version of your program

#### Fourth output from running the `listsorting` program with quick_sort

TODO: Provide an output from running the final version of your program

#### Fifth output from running the `listsorting` program with tim_sort

TODO: Provide an output from running the final version of your program

## Program Understanding

TODO: Explain similarities and differences between selection sorting from
class and one of the sorting algorithms in your CLI listsorting.

TODO: Explain the return values of the functions implemented in class and
compare them to the return values in your CLI's sorting algorithms.
Explain any discrepancies.

## Experiment Design

TODO: Explain the setup for your experiment that you ran to characterize the
performance of the different configurations of the sorting algorithms.
For instance, you should consider the following parameters for your experiment:

- The specific sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort or merge sort)
- The starting size of the data container: small values (e.g., 1024 numbers) up
  to big values (e.g., 1,048,576 numbers)
- The total number of doubles conducted during the experiment (e.g., 5 or 10)

TODO: You may need to design a custom experiment for certain sorting algorithms
due the fact that there may be some algorithms that are inefficient!

TODO: Document and justify your choice for all of the experiment parameters.

### Research Questions

TODO: Clearly state at least three research questions that can be answered by
using the `listsorting` program. Make sure that your research questions cover
different aspects of the sorting algorithms provided by the `listsorting` program.

TODO: Write the RQs in a bulleted list.

- RQ1:

## Performance Analysis

### Empirical Evaluation

TODO: The output data tables provided above are the ones that you should
reference when you are reporting on your empirical evaluation.

TODO: Provide at least three paragraphs that explain which sorting algorithm is
fastest, by how much it is faster, and how you knew that it was faster,
referencing the data in the aforementioned command outputs and the data tables
to support your response. You should make sure that you answer each of the at
least three research questions that you posed in a previous section.

TODO: Make sure that your responses explain WHY certain configurations are faster!
TODO: This means, mentioning specific python constructs.
TODO: It is not sufficient to ONLY explain WHICH configuration is faster!

TODO: Your analysis of the results should specifically mention the doubling
ratio that is suggested by your empirical results.

### Analytical Evaluation

TODO: Using the provided source code for the different sorting algorithms, your
textbook, your experimental results, and any relevant online resources that you
cite in this reflection, define the worst-case time complexity, using the big-O
notation, for the five sorting algorithms. Please note that you do not need to
prove the worst-case time complexity; rather you may reference existing sources
(e.g., online articles or your textbook) that tell you the worst-case time
complexity and then confirm that they are correct by using your empirical results.

TODO: You should use the doubling ratio that arises from your empirical results
to suggest the likely worst-case time complexity of the studied algorithms.
