## Introduction

- Due date: Check the [Proactive Programmers Discord
server](https://discord.gg/kjah8MFYbR).
- This assignment will be submitted on GitHub following
the expectations in the syllabus on
[Assignment Submission](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-101-fall-2023/course-materials#assignment-submission).
- To begin, read this `README` and the Proactive Programmers' project
description for
[Sorting Algorithms](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/data-abstraction/engineering-efforts/sorting-algorithms/)
- Modifications to the gatorgrade.yml file are not permitted without explicit instruction.
- This assignment is an Engineering Effort and will be evaluated as
described in the
[Assessment Strategies for Engineering Efforts](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/proactive-learning/assessment-strategy/#engineering-efforts).
- You can check the
[object-processing-starter repository](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-101-fall-2023/sorting-algorithms-starter)
for any updates to this project's documentation or
source code.

## Learning Objectives

The learning objectives of this assignment are to:

1. Use Git and GitHub to manage source code file changes
2. Compare sorting algorithms empirically
3. Use big-O notation to characterize sorting algorithms
4. Write clearly about the programming concepts in this assignment.

## Seeking Assistance

Please review the course expectations on the syllabus about
[Seeking Assistance](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-101-fall-2023/course-materials#seeking-assistance).
Students are reminded to uphold the Honor Code. Cloning the assignment
repository is a commitment to the latter.

For this assignment, you may use class materials, textbooks, notes,
and the internet. However, you must use _your own_ answers, in
_you own_ words. Using ChatGTP or other AI-based language models
to generate reflection responses is not permitted. Asking questions and
learning the necessary concepts to complete the reflection is required.

Post questions to the
[Proactive Programmers Discord server](https://discord.gg/kjah8MFYbR)
or create an issue in your individual copy of the repository
describing your question 24 hours before the deadline.
Be sure to @-tag emgraber in the issue.

## Project Overview

After cloning this repository to your computer, please take the following
steps:

- Make sure that you have already installed and know how to use all of the
  programming tools that are mentioned in the description of the [Proactive
  Skills](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/proactive-skills/technical-skills/introduction-technical-skills/).
- Follow the instructions on the Proactive Programmers web site for this project
  to take all of the needed steps and to complete all of the required
  deliverables.
- Use the `cd` command to change into the directory for this repository.
- Specifically, you can change into the program directory by typing `cd square`.
- Install the dependencies for the project by typing `poetry install`.
- Run the program with its different configurations by typing:
  - `poetry run listsorting --starting-size 1024 --number-doubles 5 --approach tim`
  - Note that this is not the only configuration you should try for your experiment
  - Note that the program will not work unless you add the required source code
  - Refer to the `writing/reflection.md` for details about designing your experiment
- Please note that the program will not work unless you add the required
  source code at the designated `TODO` markers.
- Confirm that the program is producing the expected output by looking in the
  appropriate section of the project description on the Proactive Programmers
  web site. With that said, it is important to note that each student's laptop
  will likely produce different performance results when running this program.
- If you have already installed the
  [GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade) program that runs
  the automated grading checks provided by
  [GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) you can, from the
  repository's base directory, run the automated grading checks by typing
  `gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`.
- You may also review the output from running GatorGrader in GitHub Actions.
- Don't forget to provide all of the required responses to the technical writing
  prompts in the `writing/reflection.md` file.
- Please make sure that you completely delete the `TODO` markers and their
  labels from all of the provided source code. This means that instead of only
  deleting the `TODO` marker from the code you should delete the `TODO`
  marker and the entire prompt and then add your own comments to demonstrate
  that you understand all of the source code in this project.
- Please make sure that you also completely delete the `TODO` markers and their
  labels from every line of the `writing/reflection.md` file. This means that
  you should not simply delete the `TODO` marker but instead delete the entire
  prompt so that your reflection is a document that contains polished technical
  writing that is suitable for publication on your professional web site.
