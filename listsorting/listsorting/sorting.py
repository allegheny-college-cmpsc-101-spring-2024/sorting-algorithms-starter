# TODO: Add all of the source code based on the above article

# TODO: Please develop an intuitive understanding about which of
# these sorting algorithms are fast and which ones are slow. To
# build up this intuitive understand you can read additional
# online articles, check your course text book, and count
# the number of iteration constructs and basic operations.

# TODO: Make sure that you add comments to all of these functions
# so as to make it clear that you understand how each step works
